## What is important to me in my next job

### I care about people
I want to work in a fixed team for a longer period. To have time to build connections, find good ways to communicate and work together and build empathy for each other. Because this, in my experience, makes people in a team productive - and happy. 
I want to work in a place that consciously gives explicit room to enable people to build this kind of connection and values the time that is spent on team building and improvement. 
I prefer working in a cross-functional team. Collaborating with everybody and every role in my team is important to me. 

### I care about code and quality
I enjoy delivering sustainability: Writing tests and seeing them pass; planning, organizing and improving the software architecture of my project; cleaning up and refactoring. I want to take ownership of code with my team. So, I need to work in an environment and code-base that regards these things as necessary and valuable.

### I care about the product
I want to be able to be part of discussions on how to bring values for our customers, how to iterate over features. 
I wish for a trustful, respectful relationship with Product Management, where every side respects the expertise of the other and we communicate about needs - for the product, for the code and also for us as humans in our roles.

### I care about company culture
I want to work in an open culture, where feedback is appreciated, often, safe and honest. 
Your values and culture should be actively lived day to day  - especially in stressful times and when hard decisions have to be made. 
Transparency is important. It should never end when the shared information feels uncomfortable or is bad news. 
Show me that your company appreciates and actively works on diversity and inclusion. This should be driven forward by the management level.
